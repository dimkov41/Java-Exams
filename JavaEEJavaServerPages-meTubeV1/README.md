Exercises: Java EE: JavaServer Pages
====================================

Problems for exercises and homework for the ["Java Web Development
Basics" course @
SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/java-web-development-basics). Submit
your solutions on the **course page** of the **current instance**.

We will implement a simple application, only with Servlets and JSP,
exploring the most interesting exploits of the Servlet API nad
JavaServer pages.

MeTube Application v1
=====================

MeTube is an application in which you create tubes, with several
properties. It has many versions, and you will most probably see it
several times.

You will have to create a simple web application which has several pages
and 1 object entity.

Data
====

This is the data layer of the application. There is 1 data object for
you to implement.

So let's create our **Tube**. The **Tube** is a data object which stores
data about an abstract **tube**. You will see later what it will be used
for.

First implement a class **Tube** -- which has these properties:

-   **Name** -- a **String**.

-   **Description** -- a **String**.

-   **YouTubeLink** -- a **String**.

-   **Uploader -** a **String**.

Views
=====

In this application you must create several views, similar to the
pictures below:

index.jsp
=========

This is the home page, in other words the page that should be visualized
when the application starts.

The index page must contain buttons that redirect to **create-tube.jsp**
and **all-tubes.jsp**.

![](media/image1.png){width="6.3in" height="1.9458333333333333in"}

create-product.jsp
==================

This is the page where you create your tubes. It must contain **input**
field for **title**, **textarea** for **description**, inputs for
**YouTube link** and **Uploader** and a **button** which creates a
**Tube** with the given values and a **link** that returns the **home**
page.

![](media/image2.png){width="6.3in" height="3.441666666666667in"}

details-tube.jsp
================

This is the page which **renders full data** about the **selected
Tube**. The selected **Tube** should be extracted from the **database**,
using the **title** from the **query parameters**. If tube does not
exist -- write an apropriate message.

![](media/image3.png){width="6.3in" height="2.1277777777777778in"}

all-tubes.jsp
=============

Renders only the **titles** of the **Tubes**. Upon clicking a **title**
of a **Tube**, you should be **redirected** to a **details page**, with
**query parameter** -- the **title** of the **Tube**. If no tubes are
added yet -- write "No tubes -- [Create some](asd)!"

![](media/image4.png){width="6.3in" height="2.2020833333333334in"}

Servlets
========

Tube Create
===========

Implement a **Servlet** -- **TubeCreateServlet**, which listens on route
"**/tubes/create**".

Upon a **GET** request, it should return a form which accepts **4
inputs** -- a **title**, a **description,** a **YouTubeLink** and an
**uploader**.

The **form** should send a **POST** request to the **same route**.

Upon a **POST** request, you should **redirect** to
"**/tubes/details**".

Tubes All
=========

Implement a **Servlet** -- **TubeAllServlet**, which listens on route
"**/tubes/all**".

Upon a **GET** request, the **Servlet** should render a page with the
**names** of all created **Tubes**. Upon clicking a **title** of a
**Tube**, you should be **redirected** to a "**/tubes/details**", with
**query parameter** -- the **title** of the **Tube**.

Tube Details
============

Implement a **Servlet** -- **TubeDetailsServlet**, which listens on
route "**/tubes/details**".

Upon a **GET** request, the **Servlet** should extract the **Tube** with
the given **title** in the **query parameters**, and render a page with
**full information** about it.

Constraints
===========

You must use the following things while implementing your application:

-   Servlets

-   Hibernate

-   Repository layer

-   Service layer

-   Web layer
